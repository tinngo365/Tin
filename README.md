### 2022
I'm learning

These are my personal projects that I have worked on.
There isn't much right now but I plan on adding more the more I learn from my classes at Iowa State University  

The first one in my Hub was a high school project that I decided to do. I constantly made improvements even after turning in the "final" draft.
I could just keep seeing improvment and I also had plenty of time during Covid.

After learning more from taking a programming course at Iowa State, I figured I could upgrade my high school project by applying my learning from
the courses I have taken. That's where my second lemonade tycoon came from. There's still a lot of more things I would like to do with this program
but since school has started, it has come to a halt. I plan to finish it soon.

The highlight of my second tycoon game is that it reads from a file and you can add as many stores or objects into the game and it will automatically reconfigure
GUI to display the desired outcome.
